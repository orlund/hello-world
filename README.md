Comp 3521 Assignment 6 - Orlund

Hi, I am Orlund.
This is my assignment 6 for the Software Engineering course.
I work for the City as a software engineer and am finishing the last course in my degree.
There has been a lot that I have learned in this course that applies directly to my job, so it has been great.

This is a change to a file in my Hello World project.

Thanks for reading my readme!
